<h1> HOMEWORK 4 </h1>
<hr>
So far, I am experimenting with a different way to present images from HW3. I might reuse the code from HW3 if I find a simpler way to insert images. I like how the options change within that code. I may polish it up better.
I am working with functions and ids more and I think it's getting simpler.
So far, what I have done gets the job done but I admit it's more cumbersome.
