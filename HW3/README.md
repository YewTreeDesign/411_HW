<h1> HOMEWORK 3 </h1>
<hr>
So far, I have created some paths with in the game so that it's functional... Problem is I am having troubles adding images.
I've been fighting with the code for about 2 days so I could get the images to change when you progress in the
story.

If anyone has a solution to my problem, please I would like to know.


I know I need to make a string variable but I don't know where to put it.

Thank you!
